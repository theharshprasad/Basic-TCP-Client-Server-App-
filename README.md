A simple client-server application built using WinSock in C++. The server listens on a specified port, accepts client connections, and basic communication between the client and the server.

## Features
- Implemented socket creation, binding, and connection using WinSock.
- Demonstrates sending and receiving messages between client and server.

## Prerequisites
- Windows operating system.
- Visual Studio or any C++ compiler with WinSock library support.

## How to Run
1. Compile and run the `server` code.
2. Compile and run the `client` code.
